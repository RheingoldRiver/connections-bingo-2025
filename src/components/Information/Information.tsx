      <p className="font-bold">How the game works:</p>
      <ol className="mb-2 list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
        <li>The twenty-five books are divided into five categories of five books each.</li>
        <li>
          In normal Connections (where there are 4 categories of 4 things each) you get 3 mistakes allowed before you
          have to complete the puzzle or lose. In this game with 5 categories of 5 things each you get 6.
        </li>
        <li>If you "die" your life counter will just go negative.</li>
        <li>
          Yes, I know this is a client-side app and you could look at React dev tools to cheat. It's also OSS and you
          can look at the source code to cheat. You can also cheat at NYTConnections using multiple browsers so that's
          ok :)
        </li>
        <li>
          When you have guessed everything correctly (or want to give up), you can copy your guesses as a grid of emoji
          to share how well you did.
        </li>
        <li>
          Normal Connections does yellow-purple for the categories in increasing "abstractness" (not necessarily
          perceived difficulty); I've used orange-purple. "Abstractness" may be a bit subjective.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p className="font-bold">Rules for categories:</p>
      <ol className="mb-2 list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li>
          Each category should be possible to figure out based on the Goodreads pages for the books (which are linked
          from each of the squares).
        </li>
        <li>
          No category has been a Bingo square in the past, and also I picked categories that are probably too specific
          to ever be Bingo squares in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
          No category is based on my own personal experience; for example "listened to this as an audiobook" or "books I
          enjoyed" will not be categories.
        </li>
        <li>Otherwise, anything goes!</li>
